#MySQL Data Analysis Project 

Welcome to my SQL Data Analytics project! ðŸš€ This project dives into a Pizza Store dataset from Kaggle, where I explored order patterns, revenue generation, and customer preferences through hands-on SQL queries.

From designing ETL pipelines to writing advanced SQL queries, this project showcases my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights. You'll find data on total orders, revenue contributions, pizza size preferences, and much more. Whether you're interested in SQL techniques or love pizza as much as I do, I hope you enjoy exploring this project as much as I enjoyed building it!
